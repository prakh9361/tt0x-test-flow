1. How to verify post layout
      Timing vs Power on Register and SRAM data read write.
3. Grant proposal
4. Basic Shift Register verilog to test case
5. Research on DFT: 
   Testing not just working but also performance like delay, power etc.
   What extra circuit and pins should be included for testable tapeout.
   **Vocabulary needed**:
   Built-in Self Test (BIST), Scan-chain?   
6. Multi project tile
* Encoder/Digital Block
* Registers with Feedback
* SRAM with peripherals (64 or 128 x 8) https://tinytapeout.com/chips/ttihp0p2/tt_um_urish_sram_test
* Mux for selecting project
