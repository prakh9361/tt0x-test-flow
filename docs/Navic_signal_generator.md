[Source](https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/pdf/SateliteNavigation/Draft_NavIC_SPS_ICD_L1_Oct_2022.pdf)
The Pilot Signal has 2 codes

2. Secondary : 10 bit 2 reg ?

The Module will be operate in 2 modes
1. Load - Initialize the block with the starting sequences 
2. Generate - Give a the generated Code on a single pin

#Aim
To generate the pilot signal of Navic . Also measure the cross correlation with other signals .
